    startDate: "2020-06-09"
    endDate: "2022-08-30"
    highlights:
      - "Performed rate transient analysis in unconventional plays such as the Montney and Rock Creek to extract 
      reservoir characteristics, investigate well interference and reliably forecast well performance."
      - "Built parametric models to determine optimum well spacing and optimize completion design in the Montney, 
      Duvernay and Rock Creek formations."
      - "Created and optimized field development plans for several key conventional and unconventional plays 
      (Ellerslie, Rock Creek, Montney and Duvernay) yielding over two hundred locations which 
      have either been budgeted or added to the company’s long-term plan."
      - "Ran various sensitivities on short-term and long-term field development plans for optimization purposes."
      - "Provided technical input and recommendations in creating and maintaining the company’s capital budgets 
      and long-term development plans."
      - "Work closely with the Reserves team and third-party evaluators to optimize undeveloped bookings 
      across different company assets and formations."
      - "Represented the company at various subsurface meetings with the Montney Producers’ Group, presenting 
      innovative workflows to peers."
      - "Built over two hundred type curves across the Montney, Duvernay, Mannville, Cardium and Rock Creek formations, 
      evaluated type well economics and project economics for development plans and deals."
      - "Developed new and efficient workflows for evaluation and type curve generation that has eliminated ~95% of data preparation 
      steps and vastly improved project timelines."
      - "Created a one-stop database in Tableau to monitor competitor activity in plays such as the Montney and Duvernay, 
      resulting in recommending modern and effective completion designs."
      - "Prepared and presented seven divestment packages to executives - generated type curves and evaluated economics 
      for upside locations - potentially reducing the company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) by over 14 million dollars."
      - "Managed over $100,000 in engineering software, championing new software and databases that improved engineering workflows."
      - "Stewarded company’s non-operational budget of 15 million dollars by performing subsurface and economic evaluations on
       Independent Operation Notices and recommending projects that added significantly to the company’s free cash flow."
      - "Mentored other engineers both locally and internationally (Beijing) in general subsurface evaluation techniques."

    startDate: "2014-06-09"
    endDate: "2020-04-01"
    highlights:
      - "Created a workplan for evaluating all company assets for all company rights, ranked assets for development or 
      divestiture, and presented the workplan and results to upper management."
      - "Generated condensate-gas ratios, H2S maps and calculated gas and condensate in place volumes for 
      company’s Montney asset."
      - "Created a sour gas injection model in CMG IMEX to improve economics of sour oil restart and facilitate sour gas 
      egress of company’s high value oil plays; the model also predicted required surface pressures to inform compressor 
      design."
      - "Built an economics sensitivities dashboard in Tableau that calculates the impact of changes in capital and/or 
      volumes in real-time when fed a base set of economic runs."
      - "Optimized company’s conventional waterflood assets in Alberta, presented to third party evaluators, 
      resulting in an increase in reserves booking by ~700 thousand barrels."
