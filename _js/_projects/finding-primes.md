In this post, I'm going to run through a function in Python that can quickly find all the Prime numbers below a given value.  For example, if I passed the function a value of 100, it would find all the prime numbers below 100!

If you're not sure what a Prime number is, it is a number that can only be divided wholly by itself and one.  So,  7 is a prime number as no other numbers apart from 7 or 1 divide cleanly into it;  8 is not a prime number as while eight and one divide into it, so do 2 and 4.
