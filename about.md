My name is Ibiene, and I am an Oil and Gas Engineer that loves data. As a Reservoir Engineer, my job is mainly interpreting large amounts of data to understand the reservoir to ensure that oil/gas wells are successful. As part of my job, I have the opportunity to create and optimize workflows to improve efficiency, analyze large amounts of data and extract insights to move the business forward (primarily using tools such spreadsheets and Tableau). Then I got introduced to predictive modelling using Python (I started with R but ended up with Python), which opened up a new world of possibilities. So naturally, I decided to lean into it and deepen my knowledge of everything data.

This blog/portfolio shows the projects I have completed, projects in progress and a documentation of my learnings as I go deeper into this world. It has been an exciting journey, and I plan to keep adding to it!
