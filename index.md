Welcome to my website! 

My name is **Spoorthi** _(ee-bee-ay-nay)_. I am a Master of Science student at Arizona State university that loves data and problem-solving. This website is a technical journal of *projects* I have completed, *technical concepts* I feel inclined to wax eloquent about,  and *tips/tricks* I have picked up along my journey. 

I hope you enjoy your visit!
